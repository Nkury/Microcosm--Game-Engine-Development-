# Microcosm--Game-Engine-Development-
A game made with a game engine I developed from scratch using the XNA/MonoGame C# framework in Visual Studio.
The game revolves around a shrunken engineer surviving the onslaught of office supplies in a cardboard box while floating in zero gravity.

To check out my GAME ENGINE, go to CPI 311 Microcosm nkury/CPI 311 Final Project/Game Engine.

    The game engine is divided into several portions:
    
        The Physics folder contains definitions for the following classes:
            Rigidbody 
            Collider
            Sphere Collider
            Box Collider
            
        The Rendering folder contains definitions for the following classes:
            Material 
            Light 
            Renderer 
            TerrainRenderer 
            
        The GUI folder contains definitions for the following classes:
            Button
            Checkbox 
            GUIElement 
            GUIGroup 
            
        The Manager folder contains definitions for the following classes:
            InputManager
            ScreenManager
            Time
        
        The overall Game Engine folder contains definitions for the following classes:
            Camera
            GameObject
            Transform
            Sprite
            
To check out the code behind my game, go to CPI 311 Microcosm nkury/CPI 311 Final Project/Microcosm

    The game has custom game objects designed specifically for it including:
            Tennis Balls
            Chocolate Bars
            Golden Pellets
            Progress Bar (for golden nugget progression)
            Microcosm- which combines everything into the final product of the game
